This code uses Mike Bailey's OpenGL sample program as a base.

## How to use

Once the files are downloaded, go into the Final folder. Right-click on [Sample.sln](Final/Sample.sln) and open it in Visual Studio.

It would appear that I've uploaded the wrong version of my code, so it won't display the correct output if run at the moment.

A fixed version will be uploaded when I find it.
